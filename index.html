            <h3>Where Does the Name 'Cappuccino' Come From?</h3>
            <p>
              It's a coffee world. Pour-over, French press, macchiato, espresso, cappuccino: all of them are fancy ways to take your morning caffeine infusion.

              Many of the terms for coffee drinks come to us from Italian, where they are terms of utility. 
              Espresso comes from the Italian word that means "pressed-out," which explains how the coffee drink is made; macchiato is short for "caffe macchiato," which means "coffee with a spot (of milk).
              " But cappuccino bucks the trend: it comes from an Italian word that refers not to coffee, but to friars.

            <h3>Capuchins</h3>
            <p>
              The Capuchins were also renowned for their dress. They wear a simple brown robe that includes a long, pointed hood that hangs down the back. The Italian word for this distinctive hood, cappuccio, gave rise to the Italian name for the order. It also gave rise to the Italian word for a friar of the Capuchin order used in the excerpt above: cappuccino.

When the cappuccino drink was first introduced in Italy, it was named after the Capuchin friars because the color of the espresso mixed with frothed milk was similar to the color of the Capuchin robe. The name, whimsical in a world of utilitarian coffee-drink names, stuck; we borrowed it into English in the late 1800s.
